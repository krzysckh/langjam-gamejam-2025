$ make main.bin vm rl.so && ./vm main.bin

this was meant to be a submission for https://langjamgamejam.com

this is the code i wrote for this jam.
there's some nasty bug i've introduced somewhere
that makes some code in main.S dependant on certain memory layout
where it should not (see: verywrong.mp4).

i weren't able to debug it nor submit anything before the deadline.

this was very fun, though the choice of "crazy, undebuggable assembly"
alongside a "tiny, undebuggable vm" as a target language combo was not the wisest.
